        <h1>Smosh</h1>
      
        <blockquote>
          Smosh is an American YouTube sketch comedy-improv collective, independent production company, and former social networking site founded by Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox. In 2002, Padilla created a website named "smosh.com" for making Flash animations, and he was later joined by Hecox. They began to post videos on Smosh's YouTube channel in the fall of 2005 and quickly became one of the most popular channels on the site.

        <p><span>I</span>
      n 2017, Padilla departed the channel to pursue independent ventures and focus on his own separate platform. Then, on November 6, 2018, Smosh's parent company, Defy Media, abruptly closed its doors without prior notice. Just six days later, the Smosh cast released a video assuring fans that production of Smosh, Smosh Pit, and Smosh Games content would continue independently. They pledged to complete existing projects and release new content on their YouTube channels.
      
      Subsequently, they found a new home under Mythical Entertainment after Rhett & Link acquired the company on February 22, 2019. Following four years under Mythical's ownership, a significant development unfolded in June 2023: Padilla returned to the fold. In a move that marked a milestone for the brand, he and Hecox, his longtime collaborator, reclaimed ownership of Smosh from Mythical, reinstating it as an independent entity.</p>
