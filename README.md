#Typography Only for Smosh

Smosh is an American YouTube sketch comedy-improv collective, independent production company, and former social networking site founded by Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox. They now post the majority of their content on Youtube and Instagram.

I Chose these colors because Smosh has a very fun and light hearted vibe to them. There's no set colors to their company but they tend to do lighter desatured colors.

All information in the project are from wikipedia and myself.

A web project to experiment with CSS typography.
